## Savings damping

One runaway command — a `rg` that emits ~26M tokens of matches — otherwise dominates
every lifetime figure `rtk gain` and `rtk cc-economics` report. That input was never a
real token cost: Claude Code truncates terminal output at ~50KB (~12,500 tokens) before
the model sees any of it.

`tracking.damping_ceiling` sets the token count above which savings analytics compress
the raw input logarithmically, so outliers still rank first without swamping everything
else:

| Raw input tokens | Reported as | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8,000 | 8,000 | Below the ceiling — untouched. |
| 12,500 | 12,500 | At the ceiling — no cliff. |
| 1,000,000 | 67,275 | Compressed, still the largest entry. |
| 26,000,000 | 108,002 | ~8.6x the ceiling instead of ~2080x. |

This is strictly **view-only**. The tracking database keeps raw `input_tokens` forever;
damping is applied while aggregating, on read. Set `damping_ceiling = 0` and every
reported number reverts exactly to the raw values.

```toml
[tracking]
damping_ceiling = 0         # report raw counts, outliers and all
```

## Awareness level

`rtk init` writes a short instructions file for your agent (`~/.claude/RTK.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, …).
`awareness.level` sets how much it says about RTK. Output is condensed the same way at every level.

| Level | The agent is told | Pick it when |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| `default` | How to read condensed output. Nothing about RTK. | Hook-based agent, RTK stays invisible. |
| `high` | `default` + what RTK is and `rtk gain`, `rtk proxy`, `RTK_DISABLED=1`, `rtk discover`. | You want to ask the agent about savings or to bypass RTK. |
| `full` | `high` + "prefix every command with `rtk`". | Agent without a hook, or you want the agent to drive RTK itself. |

```toml
[awareness]
level = "high"
```

Re-run `rtk init -g` (or your agent's init command) to rewrite the file.

Agents without a hook (Codex CLI, Cline, Windsurf, Kilo Code, Antigravity, Kimi) always get `full`,
since the agent must type `rtk` itself. `rtk init` prints a note when it does this.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RTK_DISABLED=1` | Disable RTK for a single command (`RTK_DISABLED=1 git status`) |
| `RTK_RECALL=0` | Disable the recall store for a single command |
| `RTK_RECALL_DB` | Override the recall database path |
| `RTK_TEE=0` | Legacy alias of `RTK_RECALL=0` (still honored) |
| `RTK_TEE_DIR` | Override the tee directory (tee mode) |
| `RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` | Disable telemetry |
| `RTK_HOOK_AUDIT=1` | Enable hook audit logging |
| `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` | Skip env validation (useful with Next.js) |

## Recall system

When a command fails — or a filter trims a long list — RTK persists the full output to an embedded database and prints a recall hint:

```
FAILED: 2/15 tests
[full output: rtk recall 36365b69eda6]
```

Your AI assistant runs `rtk recall <hash>` exactly as printed in the hint — that is the whole agent interface. For humans inspecting the store: `rtk recall <hash> --full | --from N | --lines N | --grep PAT` and `rtk recall --list`. Storage is byte-faithful (`BLOB` + lossless gzip); the stored input is the captured command text, as with the previous tee files.

### Choosing the recovery mode

The simplest way is the CLI — no file editing needed:

```bash
rtk config recall           # show the active mode and its source
rtk config recall sqlite    # hash-addressed sqlite store (default)
rtk config recall tee       # legacy .log files in ~/.local/share/rtk/tee/
rtk config recall disabled  # no recovery storage
```

Setting a mode rewrites only the relevant keys in `config.toml` (comments and other sections are preserved), and migrates a legacy `[tee]` section — its `max_files`/`max_file_size`/`directory` values are carried over. The equivalent config field, if you prefer editing the file directly, is `[retriever] mode = "sqlite" | "tee" | "disabled"` (see the full structure above).

To see how often your assistant actually goes back for elided output — and which filter caps deserve tuning — see [`rtk gain --recalls`](../analytics/gain.md#recall-efficiency).

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `retriever.mode` | `"sqlite"` | `sqlite` (default), `tee` (legacy files), `disabled` |
| `retriever.max_entry_bytes` | `10485760` | Per-entry storage cap (10 MiB) |
| `retriever.max_entries` | `200` | FIFO cap on retained entries (0 = no cap) |
| `retriever.retention_days` | `30` | Age eviction in days (0 = off) |
| `retriever.compression` | `true` | gzip stored blobs (lossless) |
| `retriever.tee_max_files` | `20` | tee mode: how many files are kept before rotation |
| `retriever.tee_max_file_size` | `1048576` | tee mode: per-file cap (1 MiB) |
| `retriever.tee_on_success` | `false` | tee mode: also archive successful runs — the legacy `[tee] mode = "always"` |
| Max file size | 1 MB | Truncated above this |

## Excluding commands from auto-rewrite

Prevent specific commands from being rewritten by the hook:

```toml
[hooks]
exclude_commands = ["git rebase", "git cherry-pick", "docker exec"]
```

Patterns match against the full command after stripping env prefixes (`VAR=val`), so `"psql"` excludes both `psql -h localhost` and `PGPASSWORD=x psql -h localhost`.

Subcommand patterns work too: `"git push"` excludes `git push origin main` but not `git status`.

An entry names a tool RTK has a filter for, and covers the wrapper, interpreter and path spellings
of it. Before matching, RTK peels those off the command and matches what is left, so
`"playwright"` excludes `playwright test`, `npx playwright test` and `pnpm exec playwright test`
alike; `"pytest"` also covers `python3 -m pytest tests/`, and `"phpunit"` covers
`vendor/bin/phpunit` and `php vendor/bin/phpunit`.

Three spellings are not peeled yet, and still rewrite despite a matching entry:

| Entry | Command | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `"head"`, `"tail"` | `head -20 f`, `tail -n 5 f` | The line-range form takes a fast path that returns before the exclusion is consulted ([#2823](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/issues/2823)). Without a line range, `head f` is excluded normally. |
| `"gradlew"`, `"mvn"` | `gradlew.bat build`, `mvnw.cmd test` | Path stripping splits on `/`, so a `.bat`/`.cmd` spelling never reduces to the tool name. `./gradlew` and `gradlew` are both excluded ([#3617](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/pull/3617)). |
| `"golangci-lint"` | `golangci run ./...` | `golangci run` is one of the rule's own aliases and is kept whole, so it does not match the `golangci-lint` entry. Exclude `"golangci"` as well to cover it. |

A tool RTK has no filter of its own for is matched as typed, because RTK only sees the wrapper:
with `["my-tool"]`, `npx my-tool` still rewrites to `rtk npx my-tool`. Exclude `"npx"` to stop
that.

The arguments are kept when peeling, so an anchored pattern still narrows the way you wrote it:
`"^ls$"` excludes a bare `ls` without swallowing `ls -la`. Matching stays exact — `"go"` never
excludes `golangci-lint`, subcommand patterns stay literal (`"git push"` does not widen to all of
`git`), and an entry never leaks to a different tool that happens to share an RTK filter: `"read"`
does not exclude `cat`, and `"eslint"` does not exclude `biome`.

Patterns starting with `^` are treated as regex:

```toml
[hooks]
exclude_commands = ["^curl", "^wget", "git rebase"]
```

Invalid regex patterns fall back to prefix matching.

Or for a single invocation:

```bash
RTK_DISABLED=1 git rebase main
```

## Telemetry

RTK sends one anonymous ping per day (23h interval). No personal data, no file paths, no command content.

Data sent: device hash, version, OS, architecture, command count/24h, top commands, savings %.

To opt out:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Via config.toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false
```

## Custom filters

Add your own filters (or override built-ins) in either location:

- **Project-local** — `.rtk/filters.toml` in your project root (committed with the repo)
- **User-global** — `~/.config/rtk/filters.toml` (applies to every project)

See [`src/filters/README.md`](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/blob/master/src/filters/README.md) for the full TOML DSL reference.

### Trusting custom filters

Because a filter can rewrite what your AI assistant sees, custom filter files are **not applied until you trust them**. An untrusted (or edited) filter file is skipped silently on the command path. You review and manage trust with explicit commands:

```bash
rtk trust      # shows each filter and asks to confirm (--yes to skip the prompt)
rtk untrust    # revokes trust
```

`rtk init` also detects existing filters and lets you enable them — interactively, or non-interactively with `--trust-filters` / `--no-trust-filters`. Trust is tied to the file's contents (SHA-256), so editing a trusted file requires re-running `rtk trust`.

> **Upgrading:** earlier versions applied `~/.config/rtk/filters.toml` without trust. After upgrading, the user-global file is gated like project filters — if you already relied on a global filter, run `rtk trust` once to re-enable it.
