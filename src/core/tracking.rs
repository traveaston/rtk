//! Token savings tracking and analytics system.
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive tracking of RTK command executions,
//! recording token savings, execution times, and providing aggregation APIs
//! for daily/weekly/monthly statistics.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - Storage: SQLite database (~/.local/share/rtk/tracking.db)
//! - Retention: 90-day automatic cleanup
//! - Metrics: Input/output tokens, savings %, execution time
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rtk::tracking::{TimedExecution, Tracker};
//!
//! // Track a command execution
//! let timer = TimedExecution::start();
//! let input = "raw output";
//! let output = "filtered output";
//! timer.track("ls -la", "rtk ls", input, output);
//!
//! // Query statistics
//! let tracker = Tracker::new().unwrap();
//! let summary = tracker.get_summary().unwrap();
//! println!("Saved {} tokens", summary.total_saved);
//! ```
//!
//! See [docs/tracking.md](../docs/tracking.md) for full documentation.
